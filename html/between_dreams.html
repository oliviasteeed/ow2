                            design and creating a graphic visual identity to iterate into a microsite prototype for a
                            cultural arts client. Our microsite accompanies an art exhibition of tapestries telling the
                            story of dreamlike hallucinations experienced by the artist. The site walks users through
                            the narrative, materials, and processes used to create the tapestries, enhancing
                            understanding and appreciation while conveying their eerie and surreal themes. The full
                            tapestries are never shown, opting instead for close-ups of tapestry details, encouraging
                            viewers to visit the exhibition to see the works in full.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">
                            This project taught me that good design is digestible expression of deep domain
                            understanding.
                            <br><br>

                            <span class="bold-p-small">The details are the design, and the design is the
                                presentation.</span> Weekly presentations sharing project progress for critique taught
                            me that ideas are only as valuable as your ability to sell them. As the main content
                            strategist, I created the narrative and slides each week to present our process as a
                            compelling story.<br><br>

                            <span class="bold-p-small">You should be able to justify every design decision.</span> In
                            weekly critique, it became clear that nothing could be done "just because." This led to
                            considering design decisions more holistically, drawing on domain and client knowledge, to
                            ensure all decisions were grounded.<br><br>

                            <span class="bold-p-small">Don't design in your head.</span> Each project is an opportunity
                            to learn as much as possible about a domain, through secondary research on history and
                            context, and about visual design, by referencing existing patterns, and studying work of
                            designers across industries. <br><br>
