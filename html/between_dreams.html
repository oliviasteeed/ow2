                        <p class="p-small">This project was centered around learning art direction and interaction
                            design and creating a graphic visual identity to iterate into a microsite prototype for a
                            cultural arts client. Our microsite accompanies an art exhibition of tapestries telling the
                            story of dreamlike hallucinations experienced by the artist. The site walks users through
                            the narrative, materials, and processes used to create the tapestries, enhancing
                            understanding and appreciation while conveying their eerie and surreal themes. The full
                            tapestries are never shown, opting instead for close-ups of tapestry details, encouraging
                            viewers to visit the exhibition to see the works in full.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">The project began by studying the work of precedent designers to extract
                            guiding design qualities. These were applied in three weeks of graphic exploration, where
                            concepts were explored extensively, before being refined into three distinct art direction
                            strategies expressed as posters and graphic assets. The work of precedents influenced our
                            semantic and practical approach and encouraged us to expand our exploration beyond design
                            software, for example using photography and a scanner to abstract type and imagery.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">Creating the visual identities involved pushing boundaries of legibility and
                            structure, which initially came at the cost of cohesion. A challenge was maintaining an
                            exploratory approach while retaining underlying design principles. To ensure the work had
                            intention, the tapestry imagery and narrative became the driving force of the project, with
                            all visuals aiming to abstract and enhance their meanings. This facilitated meaningful
                            exploration in a narrowed design domain and led refinement of graphic explorations into
                            distinct art direction strategies with specific identity goals.</p>

                            This project taught me that good design is digestible expression of deep domain
                            understanding.

                            me that ideas are only as valuable as your ability to sell them. As the main content
                            strategist, I created the narrative and slides each week to present our process as a
                            compelling story.<br><br>

                            <span class="bold-p-small">You should be able to justify every design decision.</span> In
                            weekly critique, it became clear that nothing could be done "just because." This led to
                            considering design decisions more holistically, drawing on domain and client knowledge, to
                            ensure all decisions were grounded.<br><br>

                            designers across industries. <br><br>
