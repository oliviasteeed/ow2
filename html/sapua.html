                            part of is very complex, and customers rely on help documentation to learn and effectively
                            use the product. Its help documentation already used some visuals, but they took more time
                            than writing, so most saw them as not worth the investment. In the customer research project
                            I also conducted during my internship, I received overwhelming feedback that visuals made
                            article consumption easier and solidified concept understanding by making articles less
                            intimidating, more scannable, and easier to read.</p>

                            numerical and qualitative data into visual, understandable insights to drive organizational

                            Help Portal articles consist of mainly text, but topic complexity often necessitates visuals
                            like diagrams, screenshots, and videos. When I joined, multiple contributors were creating
                            visual content for the help documentation, but guidelines were loose and did not cover all
                            format options.</p>

                        <h3>The original brief: update the help diagram guidelines</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">In the first weeks of my internship as a user assistance developer, I was
                            tasked with a small project of updating the existing help diagram guidelines. SAP had
                            recently released an update to their design system, and it was ideal that our imagery was
                            consistent with the central brand and product design guidelines. </p>
                        <p class="p-small">
                            This seemed like an easy enough project and I got to work right away, happily messing around
                            in Figma with the new brand colours and type. At this point, I was hungry to prove myself
                            and wanted to make something really cool and out of the box. Most of the help diagrams were
                            some variation on a flowchart, and I tried numerous other approaches to create more unique
                            diagrams. However, I quickly realized that I lacked the context to understand how the
                            diagrams were being used, and how the authors that usually made them felt about the process.
                            I needed more information to ensure I was fulfilling the diagrams’ actual use case.</p>

                                new brand design system, reducing Help Portal credibility. Something was not adding up.

                    <div class="project-chunk">
                        <h3>It’s time to talk to some people</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">I reached out to 4 of the user assistance authors to talk about their usage
                            of the existing help diagram guidelines, and any pain points they encountered. This was an
                            informal research method, but helped me understand my audience.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">From this, I learned that the authors were nondesigners, and were intimidated
                            by making visual content. They wanted something very ‘plug and play’ that would not depend
                            on their skill or judgment to match the brand guidelines, and look visually appealing. This
                            made it obvious that my out-of-the-box ‘thinking beyond boxes’ approach was completely
                            misguided, and that the diagram components had to be as modular and easy to reconfigure as
                            possible. Flowcharts it was.
                        </p>

                    <div class="project-chunk">
                        <h3>Okay I know what they need, now to make it happen</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">The current guidelines existed in a PowerPoint, and while trying to update
                            them I realized that I had never in my life used PowerPoint. I also realized that after
                            finding a home in Figma, PowerPoint felt like returning to prehistoric times, basically one
                            step away from a command-line interface. I used Figma for the diagram design ideation, and
                            while reviewing my work, my colleague who was a professionally trained Microsoft user
                            (including PowerPoint!) continually stressed how Figma was so much easier and more fun to
                            use. I thought about how the authors said it was intimidating to make visuals when they had
                            too many degrees of freedom, and thought about how much manual work using Figma autolayout
                            would mitigate…</p>

                        <figure class="image-box">

                        <p class="p-small">I made the call to switch the guidelines to Figma, and formalized the diagram
                            design and component updates there. I also added a significant section on how to use the
                            guidelines, as the previous version only provided visual assets with no explanation of use
                            case or considerations. I knew from talking to them that the authors using the guidelines
                            were not naturally visual people, so asking them to create diagrams with no guidance was a
                            tall order.

                        <h3>Explaining the why and how</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">To decrease the learning curve, I started the file by walking the reader
                            through an example, from ideation, listing possible elements to include, sketching and
                            mind-mapping, creating a rough draft in a design software, and finally polishing it by
                            tightening the spacing and alignment. Then I included assets to copy and paste or use as a
                            library, and ample examples to base new diagrams off of. If they weren’t such an
                            overwhelming and stressful thing to make, authors would likely make more diagrams, which
                            would only help our help readers. For those who were uncomfortable trying a new design
                            software, I created a complementary PowerPoint version with all the same guidance, assets,
                            and templates.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">Because I was on a video team and had the expertise to do so, I scripted,
                            recorded, and edited tutorial videos explaining the diagram process and working through an
                            example, as well as sharing some basic Figma and PowerPoint tips to help educate authors and
                            drive adoption of the new guidelines, and of diagrams in general.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">I also created a complementary PowerPoint version with all the same guidance,
                            assets, and templates to accommodate those who weren’t comfortable trying a new software.

                        <h3>And then it was done (or so I thought)</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">Once I had finished the diagram and screenshot guidelines, converted most of
                            the diagrams, and released the Figma and PowerPoint files to the documentation creators, I
                            thought the project was done and moved on to the next one.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">That turned out to be a prototype of a new style of animated video to explain
                            concepts. My team was already adept at creating screencast tutorial videos explaining
                            product features, but these videos were very procedural and did not cover the ‘why’ behind
                            actions.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p class="p-small"> Because of my visual design skills, we were able to try out this new medium,
                            and I storyboarded and animated most of the video (which you can watch here). It became
                            clear during animation, however, that I needed to document what I was doing for asset
                            creation, export, and animation so that my colleagues could help animate sections, and so
                            that the style would be sustainable after my internship ended and I returned to university. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="p-small"> I made a styleguide covering the Figma asset creation and export, and all
                            the animation conventions I used in AfterEffects, including example assets, files, and
                            detailed written documentation. To match the new central SAP design system, I also made a
                            new video thumbnail template to use for this video, and update previous and subsequent
                            videos.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="project-chunk">
                        <h3>Doing the same thing again (and again)</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">For the animated video, I created and used simplified user interface (SUI)
                            graphics to explain concepts while keeping content accessible, keep focus only on relevant
                            areas, and increase video longevity (the product is updated every two weeks so the interface
                            specifics are always changing). My team began to question if these SUI graphics would also
                            be useful in the help documentation for the same reasons, so I created a library of SUI
                            graphics including one for every major screen and interaction of the product, and of key
                            widgets and panels.</p>

                        <p class="p-small"> Also, while working on the animated video, someone on my team asked if I
                            could animate a short GIF to show new features in an updates release carousel in the
                            product. This sounded like a cool opportunity to have my work published in the product, so I
                            modified some of my SUI graphics to illustrate the new features, and animated them into a
                            few short GIFs to accompany each carousel page. </p>

                        <p class="p-small"> After working on this, I realized that GIFs seemed like a great middle
                            ground between videos and screenshots, which addressed the user research feedback I was
                            gathering at the same time that people wanted visuals but they also wanted speed, and videos
                            were too long to commit to. At the same time, not everything can be adequately explained
                            with screenshots, and more complex or long interactions would need multiple screenshots
                            which would take up a lot of screen real estate, making articles longer, and more
                            overwhelming. It seemed then, that GIFs would be useful in articles too to condense
                            information into a short, scannable visual.</p>

                        <h3>Dawn of the mega styleguide</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">In my concurrent ongoing user research project about the help documentation,
                            once of the key pieces of feedback was that SAP offered too many resources, but there was no
                            central place to access them, so people got confused about what there was to access and how
                            to find it, ending up with lists of bookmarks to different disparate sources. I could
                            relate, because my experience navigating files in Figma was similar. I was growing the
                            amount of UA multimedia and visual-related files I made, but unless I kept all my tabs open
                            at once, it felt like they were lost in the ether.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">It suddenly seemed very obvious that I should make a Mega Styleguide
                            including all of the visual and multimedia help documentation enhancements that I had worked
                            on thus far. It would include directions and assets to create diagrams, screenshots, SUI
                            graphics, animated GIFs, screencast and animated videos, and video thumbnails, and it would
                            all be explained and easy to use for the nondesigner documentation creators, and for my team
                            once I left, as I had picked up making most of the visual and multimedia content.</p>

                        <h3>Pitching the project</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">I had a lot of leeway with what I did in my internship, but I didn’t want to
                            be allocating a large proportion of my time to something without support from my team and
                            manager first. I hunted down the styleguide files I had made thus far and showed my manager
                            and supervisor, pitching the project to make a unified asset library with accompanying
                            documentation. This would make it accessible for anyone to make visual and multimedia </p>

                        <p class="p-small">Thankfully, they both loved the idea, and shared that other teams had seen
                            our animated video prototype and wanted to use the same style, so this would be useful even
                            beyond my immediate colleagues for the whole Data and Analytics Design organization to
                            create unified multimedia and visual content.

                    <div class="project-chunk">
                        <h3>Making the masterpiece (unbiased description)</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">Now that I had support from my team, I could go ahead and dedicate some time
                            to my new pet project. I honestly intimidated by how much I would have to cover and explain
                            in the guide, but all I could do was start.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">I made a master Figma file with a page for each resource type, and included
                            an introduction and explanation of what each resource was and when to use it, a written and
                            visual example walkthrough of making the resource, assets and templates to use in creation,
                            and a gallery of examples.</p>

                        <p class="p-small"> As I finished resource sections, I was informally testing the content on my
                            three team members as we worked on subsequent projects involving visual and multimedia
                            content creation, to ensure my instructions were understandable, and adjusted accordingly. I
                            then published the guide on our company Figma so anyone could make use of it, and shared it
                            with my team.</p>

                                guidelines for creation, templates, components, and examples.</figcaption>

                        <p class="p-small">Although it took a long time to develop, write, and design everything
                            included in the style guide, it proved to be a very valuable resource for my team, and for
                            myself during the remainder of my internship, and increased the amount of visual and
                            multimedia content we were able to produce.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">Because our projects were always changing, I would go for months without
                            making a video or GIF, and then suddenly would be making them every day depending on the
                            need and requests from other teams. The guide proved to be a very valuable resource after
                            months of not making an animation or GIF, because I knew exactly how to make them
                            consistent, and even had a step-by-step workflow example to jog my memory. This saved a lot
                            of time having to relearn the format conventions each time I made something new, and helped
                            my team get more involved in creating visual and multimedia content as well.</p>

                        <figure class="image-smaller-box">

                            <figcaption class="p-smallest">Because of the guide, we were able to expand the visual and
                                multimedia content production to include SUI graphics, GIFs, and animated videos, and
                                ensure the existing diagrams and screenshots we made were consistent.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p class="p-small">An unexpected outcome of the guide was that it did a great job of advertising
                            our services as a design team. Of course, there are directions for people to create their
                            own content, but my team already performed on-request user research and screencast videos,
                            so adding visuals and animations was not out of place, and we enjoyed the work. As a result,
                            the guide can also be used as a brochure showing the full spectrum of visual and multimedia
                            services we could offer. </p>

                        <p class="p-small"> Later in the internship, we even got to make an animated and screencast
                            video for the president of Analytics and HANA Database organization to pitch a new AI
                            product offering to the board (the highest level at SAP!) because of the increased exposure
                            to our services brought about by the guide.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">Lastly, the guide ensures that the new visual and multimedia work I did
                            during my 16-month internship to improve the help documentation can continue thanks to my
                            amazing team.</p>

                            completion. I saw the opportunity and took initiative to make a new project, marking a

                            saw gaps in our processes. After the guide, I continued to make and share process documents

                            Going into my internship, I definitely had an ‘I’m just an intern’ attitude, and expected to

                            experience at all. From my first week, I was given tasks to own myself, and nobody was
                            micromanaging me to make sure I was progressing – it was all up to me. This amount of
                            autonomy was such a gift, because it allowed me to grow my confidence and take myself
                            seriously, which reflected in the increasing amount of self-initiated work I took on.</p>

                            I love visual design and my team at SAP knew that, so when I started at my internship I took
                            on more and more of the visual component of user assistance. I was having fun and so were
                            they, but at a certain point realized that I would not be here forever, and didn’t want the
                            progress we had made on improving the help documentation to stop. My manager had mentioned
                            that the step from junior to senior designer is when you stop focusing only on personal
                            growth and development, and consider also what you can do to help others grow and develop

                            learn how to get involved with visuals, and how to continue after I left.</p>
