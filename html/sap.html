                            make it harder practically to understand and navigate, but also harder to understand.
                            Introduction of new SAP visual design system created opportunity to update help

                            Research of diagram essentials, took infographic and information design course, also studied
                            design system to ensure it was consistent. Considered accessibility in text sizing and
                            colour contrast.Deliverable was Figma library and PowerPoint template with accompanying
                            tutorial videos and written direction instructyng nondesigners (user assistance authors) on

                            also made screencast videos, but we wanted to expand past 'how-to' to more introductory
                            content. Storyboarded and designed all graphics, and completed most of animation in
                            AfterEffects, then documented visual and animation style in internal to team styleguide
                            ensuring future animated videos were consistent and efficient to create. In future animated
                            videos taught rest of team how to use assets and animation guidelines to optimize animation

                            become outdated with interface updates. To remedy this, did competitive analysis of other
                            tech product help and decided to pursue creation of simplified user interface (SUI) graphics
                            to draw attention to only desired aspect, eliminate text, and retain longevity with
                            interface updates. Created simplified user interface graphics for every part of product and
                            reusable assets for team to use in future SUI creation, as well as training nondesigner team
                            members how to use asset library to create additional graphics.</p>

                            documentation, and what to invest further resources into, I led a research project including
                            external user interviews and survey. Conducted extensive secondary research of existing UX
                            and help-related data, other tech product help competitive analysis, and then designed study
                            and wrote discussion guide and survey questions. I moderated all sessions and conducted
                            quantitative (using SAC) and qualitative data analysis to synthesize findings into research
                            report. Presented report to BTP design leads, BTP UA leads, and BTP design organization.</p>

                            specific features and opportunities, and worked with other teams to ensure user feedback was

                            This project taught me to take initiative when I see opportunity for improvement, and use
                            data to get others on board.
                            <br><br>

                            <span class="bold-p-small">Believe in your competence and others will too.</span> I was very
                            nervous to conduct sessions myself with external customers around the world, but realized
                            that if I acted confident they would take me seriously, assuming I had everything under
                            control. This extended beyond sessions to realizing I was hired for my skillset and if I
                            believed in my competence, others would as well.<br><br>

                            <span class="bold-p-small">Get to know/help out who you are working with.</span> Getting to
                            know development and UA colleagues, and doing favours for them initially, helped have more
                            reach with research findings and influence product and help portal change.<br><br>

                            <span class="bold-p-small">Be proactive, make your own projects.</span> Don't wait until you
                            are assigned or directed to take action. When you see an opportunity, pitch and take
                            ownership of a new project. Don't wait for others to come to you, initiate reaching out to
                            them, share what you have learned and ask for what you want.<br><br>
