                            especially for SAP Analytics Cloud, a very complex analytics software, about which the key
                            complaint in leading industry reports is inadequate help resources. This means the single
                            biggest effect we could have on customer experience of usability is not in the product at
                            all, but through improvements to the help documentation.</p>

                            increasingly important in large organizations, and SAP Analytics Cloud is positioned to help

                        <h3>The problem - too many articles, not enough information</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">Software changes fast, and the SAP Analytics Cloud Help Portal has over 2000
                            (!!!) articles, so inevitably content gets out of date. When I joined the team, there had
                            been a previous effort to improve the navigational experience of the Help Portal, but the
                            existing guidelines for article content were unclear, and had not been tested with user
                            research. This led to inconsistencies between articles in different help sections. </p>
                        <p class="p-small">Multiple teams were trying to improve the documentation with visual and
                            multimedia enhancements, but nobody knew what format (eg. video, click-through tutorial,
                            diagram, screenshot) people found the most useful, so we weren’t sure how the limited
                            resources could be used the most effectively. Considering the reputation of extreme
                            complexity that the product has, and the overwhelmingly negative reception of help articles
                            gauged in unrelated customer interviews and online communities, it was time to address the
                            elephant in the room and embark on the quest for the ideal help article.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">I had expressed interest in user research work, so was given the reins to
                            lead an undefined research project to learn more about how people are using the Help Portal,
                            and what media formats they preferred. This would be used to guide where we invested
                            resources, and culminate in updating the article guidelines to increase consistency and
                            usefulness across the Help Portal.</p>

                        <figure class="image-box">

                                were improving the help at all.</figcaption>

                    <div class="project-chunk">
                        <h3>Desk research - what do we already know?</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">Before too much planning, I wanted to learn everything we already knew about
                            the reception and attitudes towards the Help Portal, and the usability of SAP Analytics
                            Cloud, so I wasn’t collecting redundant data. </p>

                        <p class="p-small">I scavenged and asked for Help Portal page visit metrics, product UX metrics,
                            product usage tracking data, and at the same time took online courses on information
                            architecture, user research methods, user assistance, and technical writing to familiarize
                            myself with the domain.</p>

                        I also shadowed a user researcher to get a better idea of session moderation and study design,
                        which allowed me to practice notetaking and preparing the findings report with researcher
                        feedback.</p>

                        <h3>Designing the study</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">Once I learned what we did know, it was time to identify what we wanted to
                            know, which mainly included how people interacted with various SAP help touchpoints, how
                            they consumed help, if it was meeting their needs, and what kind of format they were looking
                            for. </p>

                        <p class="p-small">I decided to do a set of customer interviews to observe behaviour and gather
                            in-depth qualitative data, and then distribute a survey to a wider customer base to gather
                            quantitative data to back up anecdotal interview sentiments.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">I wrote a session guide and survey, and worked with research and customer
                            representative colleagues across the company to recruit customers.

                        <p class="p-small">In the first round of research, I moderated 5 customer sessions with 14 total
                            participants, guiding them through two task-scenario questions so I could observe their
                            typical help-seeking behaviours, and then conducting an open interview to gauge format
                            preferences and usability assessments. </p>

                        <p class="p-small">Although I was nervous, this was actually very fun and I loved the experience
                            of speaking directly to customers around the world, and learning what their day-to-day help
                            usage was actually like (even though they were at 5-6am to accommodate global timezones!). I
                            also shared the survey with customers to get a broader sample of product users. </p>

                        <p class="p-small">During the sessions, it became clear that mainly administrator and
                            power-users were responding to the research request, so our data was skewed towards
                            technical use cases. At the same time, recruiting was harder than I anticipated, as
                            customers prefer to participate in feature-based research that gives them the impression of
                            product influence. This was a problem, because as much as it’s ideal to be data-driven,
                            insufficient data cannot be trusted to draw universal insights. To get more participation at
                            a beginner and intermediate level, I decided to open up the session and survey research
                            request to internal users of our product, and conducted 3 more sessions of internal user
                            groups.</p>

                            the end of sessions I had written a summary of the key painpoints, insights, and
                            opportunities, and discussed with the team to sync on key takeaways. Plus, I had recorded
                            every session and had a text transcript of each as well. All of this is to say that when I
                            was done sessions, I had a lot of data to sort through to make the report, and wasn’t sure
                            where to start.</p>

                            designers using the classic sticky notes on FigJam, but neither of these methods clicked for
                            me. After some trial and error, I ended up condensing the notes for each session into a Word
                            document colour-coded by company. I then grouped notes and relevant quotes by question or
                            topic area in another document, where I could identify which company they came from based on
                            colour. From these grouped bulleted insights and quotes, I was able to summarize the
                            findings into 4 key themes, and provide recommendations with the data and quotes to back
                            them up.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">During the data analysis process, I used SAP Analytics Cloud to visualize the
                            findings data, and it became clear that the session and survey data were not exactly one to
                            one, as the survey used a lot of ranking and numerical scale questions, whereas sessions
                            were more qualitative, with the same data being gathered in a less numerical way. <b>This
                                made the data difficult to combine in it’s original state, so I worked with a team
                                member to manually clean and model data so it would align,</b> and could be shown
                            together in one chart. This was a great opportunity to see the use of analytics in action,
                            as the charts made findings obvious immediately, whereas the text data had taken hours to
                            synthesize, and taught me to consider how I will be analyzing the data before collecting it!
                        </p>

                        <p class="p-small">To share the findings, I created a slide deck report in Figma with top line
                            findings and quotes, plus an extensive appendix with specific information on formats and
                            resource attitudes for future reference. I presented this findings report to SAP’s Data and
                            Analytics Design organization of over 100 people, including design and organization leads,
                            in two sessions for different time zones.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">The reception to the report was very positive, so to capitalize on the
                            support we had for the time being, I divided the improvement opportunities into buckets of
                            what was in and out of my team’s control. </p>

                        <p class="p-small">In our control was updating the Help Portal writing guidelines to include
                            article formatting and content inclusion recommendations based on user feedback. To do this,
                            we would need to know for certain which article format and layout users like best, so would
                            have to start experimenting with proof of concept articles to test our new approach.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">Out of our control, but in our influence, was improving the findability of
                            articles with better search and an improved Help Portal interface, and increasing the amount
                            of help content produced by involving other subject-matter experts within the organization.
                            To make the case for each intervention, I would need to prepare and present recommendations
                            to specific stakeholders and ask for their participation.</p>

                        <h3>Conducting the study 2 - validation sessions</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">To test the new approach we were recommending, my colleague and I each redid
                            select articles with reimagined ordering, layout, and content based on user feedback. We
                            tried several approaches, and when we couldn’t decide which made more sense, it was clear we
                            needed more data.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">I wrote a session script, and scheduled and moderated 4 rounds of internal
                            validation testing, totalling 13 sessions. These included AB testing of different naming
                            conventions, content ordering, and information design. </p>

                        <p class="p-small"> In the first two rounds, sessions were impression tests comparing article
                            styles to get a general sense of preferences and assess things like naming and ordering. In
                            the second two rounds, participants were given tasks scenario in which they had to find
                            specific information to test what actually improved article usage in practice. Good thing we
                            did this, because the collapsable tabs everyone said they loved did not work at all in
                            practice! This project taught me that people do not know what they want or mean what they
                            say. Most complaints were about usability, not aesthetic appeal, so it was important to
                            properly assess both aspects of articles.</p>

                        <p class="p-small"> I also conducted an exploratory workshop as part of sessions where
                            participants were provided all article components cut up in Figma, and were asked to drag
                            the elements they found useful into an article frame in their ideal order while talking
                            through their thoughts. This helped us understand what people actually wanted, and why they
                            had the opinions they did about different resources. </p>

                        <h3>What happened? What does it mean?</h3>
                        <h4>Formalizing new guidelines</h4>
                        <p class="p-small">After conducting validation testing sessions, I synthesized the data and
                            created a mega report containing the themes from all of the research findings, along with 10
                            recommendations for better help articles based on user feedback.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">With my colleague, I rewrote three sections of the help documentation to test
                            the applicability of recommendations across contexts and article types to see what we were
                            missing and hone recommendations accordingly.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">One of my complaints at the start of the process was that the existing
                            documentation writing guidelines were written in an overwhelming wall of text, and it was
                            important to me that if we were updating the guidelines, we presented them using the
                            formatting we were suggesting, so the document itself was an example of what it was
                            recommending.</p>

                        <p class="p-small"> I transformed the existing written guidelines into a more visual
                            presentation format, using our own findings to ensure the information was easy to consume,
                            using scannable visuals, bullets, and steps with visual examples of do’s and don'ts for each
                            recommendation. I also created an infographic of an ideal help article for quick reference,
                            that includes the order and purpose of each article section.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p class="p-small">This project of formalizing the guidelines was also part of handover the
                            intern that was taking over for me after I left, so I worked with her to transform the
                            existing guidelines so she could get familiar with them, and give fresh insights on updated
                            recommendations. This allowed me to practice a mentorship role, and delegate tasks based on
                            learning outcomes.</p>

                        <!-- <p class="p-small"> In terms of offshoot projects beyond my team’s control, I worked with the
                            Help Portal development team to make changes to the Help Portal interface to increase
                            usability based on user feedback, and created detailed UX specs for implementation before
                            leaving. I also advocated for including help documentation search in AI assistant based on
                            user painpoints, and managed to get documentation indexing and search included in SAP-wide
                            AI assistant MVS release plan.</p> -->

                            <h4>Working with stakeholders on offshoot projects</h4>
                            <p class="p-small">At the same time, I was working with stakeholders outside of our team to
                                improve the Help Portal experience from other angles, including improving the Help Portal
                                interface, and supporting resource centralization across SAP using AI.
    
                                I put together and presented targeted reports to stakeholders across SAP including the Help
                                Portal development team, product support development lead, PMs, UA leads, and UA authors.
                                When these projects picked up traction, I worked with stakeholders and created mockups and
                                specs of recommended changes for development teams to implement.</p>

                        <h3>Why is it significant to you?</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">This was an extensive project, running from October 2023 to August 2024
                            concurrently to my other work. I had asked to be involved in user research so was given this
                            opportunity, but I ended up learning just as much if not more about project management,
                            collaboration, and presenting ideas. It was significant, because it taught me to believe in
                            my ideas, and take ownership over a project.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">Work is very different from university, in that there aren’t clear criteria
                            and success
                            metrics, and that nobody is waiting for your work. You have to advocate for what you are
                            doing to get resources and drive adoption. During this project I started using the mantra
                            “be the designer” to remind myself that at the end of the day, I was the expert and could
                            trust my judgment to make changes based on user feedback. </p>

                            Because I owned this project, I knew more about it than anyone on my team, so it came down
                            to me to advocate for its value, and get others involved. I learned to present findings and
                            recommendations with confidence so I would be taken seriously, and invite other stakeholders
                            to get involved when I saw opportunities beyond my or my team’s immediate control.</p>

                            was able to visualize the data together, but in the future would ensure this manual work
                            would be avoided by making different datapoints line up from the start.</p>

                            <p class="p-small">People do not mean what they say and do not know what they want.
                                It became clear in validation sessions especially, that people do not know what they
                                want,
                                so instead of listening to what they literally say, we stepped back to consider what
                                they
                                meant on a deeper level (cue my psychology minor). </p>

                            <p class="p-small">The clearest example of this was when in initial validation sessions,
                                every
                                participant said they would prefer article sections to be enclosed in collapsible
                                accordion
                                tabs because it made articles much less overwhelming, and that they would have no
                                trouble
                                opening them if they needed the enclosed information. Then in the second round of
                                validation
                                testing, I asked participants where they would expect to find a certain piece of
                                information
                                enclosed in the tabs, and not a single participant could find it, or thought to open a
                                tab
                                and check. I realized what people were actually asking for was less context information
                                up
                                front, not to specifically hide the information in tabs, but they said they wanted this
                                because it was the closest option to the actual solution.</p>

                            There were several times in this project that I wasn’t sure what to do with findings, or the
                            choice between options did not seem obvious, and in these cases it was invaluable to get
                            more data by asking for feedback from my colleagues, and in some cases doing more rounds of
                            user testing. Gathering input doesn’t impede creativity as I had previously wondered, but
                            allows you to make confident and creative decisions that you can justify to others. I know
                            we would not have had the support and adoption from others without the data to back it up.

                            I met with UA leads to talk about the feasibility of the new recommendations, and they
                            brought it to the documentation authors to assess, and add their input on what was
                            technically feasible to implement. </p>

                        <h4>Individual enablement</h4>
                        <p class="p-small">
                            My team would then work with individual authors on enablement to implement the new article
                            recommendations on targeted help sections based on popularity, and these sections would be
                            used as a test, and example to other authors of what help documentation should look like.

                        <h4>Formalizing guidelines</h4>
                        <p class="p-small">
                            Recommendations I wrote would be formalized into guidelines based on UA authors’ feedback,
                            and rolled out for use by all Data and Analytics Design organization product help
                            documentation.
