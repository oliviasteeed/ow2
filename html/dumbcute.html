                            Graphic design is my bread and butter, so I thought I should include an explanation of the
                            skillset (and passion) that lays the groundwork for most of my other design work.

                        <h3>Taking the leap; changing the brand</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">When I was in grade 7, I signed up for Instagram under the name
                            @artisticparrot, where I would share my paintings, drawings, and design explorations with my
                            friends and family. When I started doing ceramics at the end of high school, this became the
                            focus of the account, and when my cupboards were full, I started selling my work on Etsy
                            under the same name. Fast forward 5 years, and I was still using the same name
                            “artisticparrot” as my brand, but it no longer felt like it fit. Whereas I started making
                            bird and parrot mugs and pots, I now made mainly silly dishes shaped like inanimate objects
                            with smiley faces. Since 2020, I had been toying with changing the name to “Dumbcute” but
                            was too nervous. </p>
                        <p class="p-small">
                            In December 2023, I decided I couldn’t wait any longer, when I realized I was no longer
                            excited to make pieces for my shop because it didn’t feel like ‘me’ anymore. I had a week
                            off for Christmas and decided this was the time to revamp my shop into something I was proud
                            of once more.

                            transitioned to making happy food/object ring dishes, so my existing branding was not

                        <p class="p-small">I frequently did brand updates, and because I love graphic design, was kind
                            of always toying with the branding, but the general colours and imagery had remained stable
                            for a few years. I started by trying to just update what I had yet again, but pretty soon
                            realized I needed to go back to the foundations, by asking myself what I was trying to
                            convey.</p>
                        <p class="p-small">
                            My previous approach had used a bunch of hand-drawn parrot graphics and funky font to
                            accentuate the playful yet elegant brand identity, but it no longer suited the products I
                            sold. My ceramic work is silly. They are good quality and well-made, but there is nothing
                            serious about them. They are kitschy and silly because they are supposed to interrupt the
                            seriousness of the mundane and make people smile when they notice them throughout the day.

                        <p class="p-small">I listed the emotions, qualities, and attributes I wanted my work to convey,
                            and started writing some brand statements to guide my process. My favourite of which are
                            <b>‘thoughtful kitsch’</b> and, better yet, <b>‘thoughtful hedonism’</b> which convey that
                            my work is the result of applying a honed craft to just trying to make life fun.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p-small">
                            I can naturally be quite a serious person, but my artistic and ceramic work is where I get
                            to drop my guard and have fun. I also wrote an external tagline <b>‘pottery that’s
                                alive’</b> to capture how most of my work features cartoon faces, and isn’t just
                            inanimate pottery, but comes to life as silly characters. The name, Dumbcute, encapsulates
                            both of these (and if not, you can refer to the second choice tagline: ‘just look at them’).

                        <h3>Making the logo</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">After clarifying the brand identity, I started exploring the logo design. For
                            years I had drawn hearts, stars, suns, and such with smiley faces, so I knew the logo would
                            be something in this vein. I tried hand-drawing characters to scan and use as a logo, but
                            they felt too amateur and childish. <b>That was a tension in the new approach, as I wanted
                                to emphasize the silly and playful aspect of my work without infantilizing it.</b> </p>
                        <p class="p-small">
                            I realized that vector drawing gave a more professional effect, and added back a bit of the
                            seriousness needed to convey the quality of my products, and ensure the brand still appealed
                            to my key demographic of 18-45 year old women. I drew a series of heart characters which I
                            loved, but found the straight vector graphics a bit soulless, so opened up Photoshop and
                            used blurring and thresholds to make the outlines inconsistent width, emulating a stamped
                            effect. This subtle change added back the warmth of hand-drawing while maintaining the
                            professionalism of computer graphics. Have I mentioned I love graphic design? Anyways…

                        <h3>Working with type</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">I then moved to working with type. My previous logotype used a ridiculous
                            font that I loved, and suited the brand perfectly, and I wanted this one to have the same
                            treatment. Despite what one might learn in design school, there are fonts beyond Helvetica
                            (or Neue Haas Grotesk for the real type nerds), and I understood that the identity of
                            ‘Dumbcute’ did not call for a clean Bauhaus sans serif, but what did it call for?</p>
                        <p class="p-small">I experimented a lot in this aspect, and actually struggled to find a font
                            that suited the graphics and kept the visual continuity. I actually tried to round the
                            corners of Neue Haas in an attempt to balance professional and playful (surprise, that was a
                            dig on me previously), but despite trying to convince myself it was working, it wasn’t.

                        <h3>Colour palette interlude</h3>
                        <p class="p-small">Because type was a dead end, I used what I had for now and started working
                            with colour. I am the kind of person that loves colour, to the point where I can feel the
                            dopamine hit when I see a pretty colour (especially oranges and pinks). Artisticparrot used
                            muted pastels, and while I do lean pastel in my ceramic work, I wanted the branding to be
                            bright to reflect the playful and silly part of the identity. I started going balls to the
                            wall with saturated reds, oranges, and pinks - my favourites - until my eyes hurt. Then, as
                            is my usual process, I gradually introduce restraint until only the essential was remaining.
                            In this case, that ended up being a tight palette of cohesive, not-quite-clashing bright but
                            rich colours. I was so enamoured by the colour palette, that I was ready to tackle type
                            again.</p>

                        <p class="p-small">Taking pragmatic approach, I listed the qualities I would want the typeface
                            to have, and went through the fonts from my favourite foundries to see if I could find a
                            match. Although I was initially hesitant because I didn’t like how the letters fit together,
                            I chose GT Maru, a rounded and playful font that matched the logo graphic style perfectly.
                            Thanks to some vector editing in Illustrator, I was able to put the letters together in a
                            more appealing way, and mix upper and lowercase letters for more interest. Any time I can
                            hand kern is a good time.</p>

                            apply them to brand assets. I made a banner for my Etsy shop, social graphic templates,
                            stickers to include with purchases, and a new business card that doubles as a thank you card
                            for Etsy orders. I also retook all my product photos to match the new visual approach and
                            create a cohesive visual identity (plus I moved, and my new white walls made an excellent
                            background). </p>

                        <p class="p-small">This project was significant because I was letting go of previous branding I
                            had for 4+ years that I had outgrown, but I still loved and love now. <b>As a designer, one
                                of the hardest things is to throw away work that you’ve spent your life on, and that you
                                love, but that isn’t accomplishing the goal anymore.</b> Artisticparrot and the related
                            brand and visual identity wasn’t me anymore, and I finally realized it was time to move on.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p-small">After switching to Dumbcute, I am more excited about ceramic work than I have
                            been in a long time, and no longer feel the tension of dissonance between my ceramic work
                            and the brand I am selling it under. I also see Dumbcute as a playground that I can explore
                            other mediums in the same style, like silkscreen and stamp-making.</p>

                            branding so much. I love all the parrot doodles I did, and the logotype, but it was time for
                            a change because it wasn’t ‘me’ or my work anymore. The new Dumbcute approach captures where
                            I am at as a ceramist and person more faithfully.</figcaption>

                            interesting look, but you can add interest in many ways. I ended up vector drawing and then
                            distorting in Photoshop and in the end and much happier with the final logo than any of my
                            many many hand-drawn drafts. It’s easy to think one method or technique will be The way to
                            achieve a certain intention, but in reality there are many ways to approach design intent.

                            fun it is to define brand from somewhat scratch instead of working within the constraints I
                            made years ago, so if the worst case scenario is doing that again, I’m in.</p>

                            because I liked what I had before so much (I had actually tried previously to update to
                            Dumbcute but couldn’t made anything I liked as much so scrapped it), and when I was younger
                            I was worried about the reception to the name change. I’m glad that I finally ripped off the
                            bandaid though, because I immediately more excited to make ceramic work and share my
